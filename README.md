# Neil's Pack <p>![GitHub release (latest by date including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/neilrush/neils-pack?include_prereleases&logo=github)
My personal wabbajack mod pack. A lightweight UI and bugfix modpack with improved vanilla textures.
  
## Prerequisites
  * Skyrim installed outside of `Program Files`. 
    * use the [steam library setup tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide) if you need more than one steam library per drive.
  * Run skyrim at least once to generate your graphics settings.

  1. Download the [Wabbajack Tool](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases/latest/download/Wabbajack.exe).
  2. Place `Wabbajack.exe` in a new folder. Note: Wabbajack wont run in `/downloads`.
  3. Download the [latest pack](https://github.com/neilrush/neils-pack/releases/latest/download/Neils_Pack.wabbajack).

  7. After creating a new save and customizing your character there are some MCM settings I reccomend. 
      1. Press `ESC` and click `Mod Configuration`
      2. Goto `moreHUD` -> `Presets` and click `Load User Settings` under FISS
      3. This will load my preset for moreHUD.
      4. I also recommend setting your sprint key to shift in controls.
  8. Enjoy Skyrim ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
